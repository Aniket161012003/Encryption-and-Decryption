# Encryption-and-Decryption

This project implements classic encryption and decryption algorithms using Python, including:

- Caesar Cipher
- Vigen√®re Cipher
- Encoder/Decoder (Character shifting & transformation)

Each algorithm is encapsulated in its own module with individual logic and input/output handling.
