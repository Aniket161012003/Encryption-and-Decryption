# üîê ENCRYPTION-DECRYPTION

Welcome to the **Encryption and Decryption Projects**!  
This repository features three engaging Python-based projects that demonstrate how different cryptographic techniques can be used to secure information. From classic ciphers to modern steganography, each project highlights unique methods of encryption and decryption.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

### üî∏ Project 1: Caesar Cipher

**Description:**  
This project provides a Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text using the **Caesar Cipher** ‚Äî a classic substitution cipher where each character in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number (key).

**Features:**
- Encrypt plaintext with a specified shift key.
- Decrypt ciphertext using the same key.
- Simple, intuitive GUI for user interaction.

### üî∏ Project 2: Encoder and Decoder (Vigen√®re + Steganography)

**Description:**  
This project combines the **Vigen√®re Cipher** and **Steganography** to offer dual-layered security. Users can encrypt text using a keyword, and optionally embed the encrypted text into an image to conceal it from plain view.

**Features:**
- Encrypt and decrypt text using a secure polyalphabetic cipher (Vigen√®re).
- Hide encrypted text inside image files using steganography.
- Extract hidden messages from images with the correct key.

### üî∏ Project 3: Vigen√®re Cipher

**Description:**  
A focused implementation of the **Vigen√®re Cipher** for secure text encryption and decryption. The Vigen√®re Cipher uses a repeating keyword to shift each letter of the plaintext, offering stronger protection than monoalphabetic ciphers.

**Features:**
- Encrypt text using a user-provided keyword.
- Decrypt ciphertext back to original text using the same keyword.
- Simple command-line interface for input/output.
